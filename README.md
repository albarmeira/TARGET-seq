# TARGET-seq single cell genotyping pipeline

This pipeline provides an integrated framework for the analysis of single-cell targeted sequencing data obtained using TARGET-seq method. The pipeline processes raw .fastq files or aligned and sorted .bam files, and outputs counts tables for every mutation assessed. 

# How to run 

perl SCgenotype.pl -c SCpipe.conf

# Input files
